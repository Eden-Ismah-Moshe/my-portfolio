  "I'm Eden, I'm a bachelor's student in computer science and I'm excited to find my first job in the high-tech world. In addition to my degree, I take part in the QueenB association where I guide eighth grade girls in the first stages of learning to write code and mainly show them that they too can be programmers and even enjoy it. \n Beyond studies and training, I am passionate about sports, food and spending as much time as possible with the most perfect nephews in the world.\n \n Right now my main goal is to find a job where I can apply my skills, a job where I can learn anew every day and integrate into a company where I can develop professionally and personally.";
